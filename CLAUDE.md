## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 2

Pick a starter and a stack for the PRD you wrote in Lesson 1, with the **stack chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd)  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  (bootstrapper)
```

The PRD chain ships from Lesson 1 (re-included in this lesson so you can fix the PRD mid-flight). `/10x-tech-stack-selector` is the lesson's main topic; `/10x-bootstrapper` is the next link, taught in Lesson 3.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Stack selection (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-tech-stack-selector` | You have a PRD at `context/foundation/prd.md` and need to pick a starter. Opens with an explicit choice (take the recommended default for your `(product_type, language_family)` cell, or design your own), walks the follow-up question set when you design your own, applies four agent-friendly quality gates, reasons over the language-aware starter registry, and writes `context/foundation/tech-stack.md`. Optional `[path-to-prd]` argument lets you point at a non-default PRD location (e.g., `/10x-tech-stack-selector @context/foundation/prd-v2.md`); without it the skill defaults to `context/foundation/prd.md`. Use AFTER `/10x-prd`, BEFORE `/10x-bootstrapper`. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-init` / `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` | Bundled so you can fix the PRD mid-flight. If `/10x-tech-stack-selector` surfaces a gap (e.g., a Functional Requirement that forces a feature your recommended starter doesn't carry), re-run `/10x-prd` to amend the PRD before the stack pick. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-tech-stack-selector` reads `context/foundation/prd.md` frontmatter (`product_type`, `target_scale`, `timeline_budget`) as priors. If the PRD is absent, it refuses with a one-sentence redirect to `/10x-shape` — no inline mini-PRD fallback.
- The skill writes `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` with a 4-key frontmatter (`starter_id`, `package_manager`, `project_name`, `hints`) plus a one-paragraph `## Why this stack` body. The hand-off is intentionally minimal — bootstrapper does not parse rationale, only fields.
- `/10x-bootstrapper` (Lesson 3) reads `tech-stack.md` and the registry to scaffold the project.

### What tech-stack-selector captures (and what it does NOT)

- **Captured**: starter pick (registry-shaped), language family, package manager (open string per ecosystem — `pnpm`, `uv`, `bundle`, `cargo`, etc.), team size, deployment target (drawn from the chosen starter's `deployment_defaults`), CI/CD provider + flow, bootstrapper confidence (`verified | first-class | best-effort`), path taken (standard | custom), self-check answers (custom path), quality override (set when the user proceeds with a starter that failed ≥1 agent-friendly gate), feature flags (auth/payments/realtime/AI/background-jobs).
- **NOT captured (deliberate)**: strategic test plan, strategic deployment plan, strategic implementation decisions. Those are downstream of stack selection — a future technical-roadmap concern, not yet planned. Tech-stack-selector owns *framework-shaped* test/deploy/CI choices because those are inseparable from stack pick; what defers is the *strategic* layer ("we TDD on X surface", "preview environment per PR").

### The opening choice (load-bearing)

The first question is an explicit choice — never silent. The skill names the recommended starter for your `(product_type, language_family)` cell up front and asks for explicit confirmation:

- **Standard path** — accept the recommended default. The skill skips the feature audit, team profile, tech preferences, and framework-variant questions; it asks only the deployment, CI/CD, and project-name questions. The hand-off records `path_taken: standard` under `hints`.
- **Custom path** — design your own. The skill walks the full follow-up set (feature audit, team profile, tech preferences, deployment, CI/CD, framework variant), drills into a testing-runner question only when the chosen starter leaves it ambiguous, and closes with a 5-point readiness self-check (from prework lesson 4.1) before locking in. The hand-off records `path_taken: custom` and populates `self_check_answers`.

The recommended-default-per-cell map is multi-language: web/JS and saas/JS both → 10x-astro-starter (the 10x-branded starter leads whenever it competes in a JS cell); api/JS → hono; api/Python → fastapi; web/Python → django; web/Ruby → rails; api/Go → go; api/Rust → axum; mobile/Dart → flutter; desktop/Rust → tauri; etc. Cells with no vetted default carry `<none>` and force the custom path.

### Quality gates (agent-friendly criteria)

Every starter card carries four booleans the LLM filters against:

1. **Typed** — explicit types/schemas the agent can reason from without running the program.
2. **Convention-based** — strong opinions on layout, routing, configuration.
3. **Popular in training data** — assessed *per language family*, not globally (Django is popular within Python training data; Spring within Java; etc.).
4. **Well-documented** — current, version-pinned, link-able docs.

Candidates failing any gate are excluded from the unprompted recommendation set. If you explicitly name a failing starter as your preference, the skill challenges that pick — surfacing the strongest higher-criteria alternative AND the compensation path (CLAUDE.md instructions that patch the gaps) — and asks you to confirm or pivot. Confirming the known-friction pick records the override on the hand-off so bootstrapper can adjust.

### Bootstrapper confidence

Every recommendation surfaces `bootstrapper_confidence` verbatim — never silently elided:

- **`verified`** — bootstrapper has been run end-to-end on this stack; scaffolding will be smooth.
- **`first-class`** — registered with a valid CLI, expected to work but not battle-tested; expect mostly-smooth scaffolding with occasional manual steps.
- **`best-effort`** — limited support; manual steps likely; expect friction (and bootstrapper's CLAUDE.md generation compensates with extra ecosystem-specific context).

This is the heads-up before running `/10x-bootstrapper` so you know what to expect.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` — input (from Lesson 1)
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — output (the chain hand-off)
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry

### Universal language

The shipped skill carries no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The recommended-default registry is multi-language (JS, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, .NET, Dart) and the cohort's `10x-astro-starter` is one card in the JS+web cell — not "the" recommended path for everyone.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."

## Repository notes (not synced by 10x-cli — safe to edit)

### Current state

This repository has no application code yet. The project is **SubTracker**, a web app for tracking personal subscriptions, with duplicate detection, budget alerts, and a subscription lifecycle state machine. The shaping chain has run: `context/` is scaffolded, and `context/foundation/` holds `shape-notes.md` and `prd.md`. The next step is stack selection (`10x-tech-stack-selector`), which ships in a later lesson and is not installed here yet.

### Where the skills actually live

- `.claude/skills/10x-init/`, `.claude/skills/10x-shape/`, `.claude/skills/10x-prd/`, `.claude/skills/10x-idea-check/` — the shaping-chain skills plus the pre-shaping idea assessor (`/10x-idea-check`, not mentioned in the synced block above — use it before `/10x-shape` when it's unclear whether an idea is worth shaping at all).
- `.agents/skills/10x-cli-setup/` — installs/troubleshoots the `10x` CLI itself (npm/npx runner, auth, course access). Unrelated to the shaping chain; only relevant when the CLI or skill downloads are misbehaving.
- `.claude/skills/10x-shape/references/prd-schema.md` — the single source of truth for `shape-notes.md` and `prd.md` structure. Both `/10x-shape` and `/10x-prd` re-read it at runtime; if it and a SKILL.md ever disagree, the schema wins.

### Skill files are synced, not hand-authored

`skills-lock.json` and `.claude/.10x-cli-manifest.json` track skill provenance (source repo + content hash) for content pulled via the `10x` CLI (`10x get`/`10x sync`). Treat files under `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` as generated: don't hand-edit them expecting the change to stick — a future sync can overwrite it. If a skill's behavior needs to change, that's an upstream change in `przeprogramowani/10x-cli`.

### Known drift vs. the synced block above

The synced block above describes the toolkit's intended shape but has fallen behind the skill versions actually installed here. When in doubt, read the real `SKILL.md` — it's authoritative, not the summary above:

- `/10x-shape` supports both greenfield and brownfield (auto-detected from repo signals), not "Greenfield only."
- `/10x-init` scaffolds only `context/{changes,archive,foundation}/` + a `README.md` in each. It does **not** create `lessons.md` or `contract-surfaces.md` — those paths mentioned above are aspirational/not yet implemented by the installed skill.
- The PRD schema has no `## Data Model` section (retired) — entities emerge from FRs/User Stories and are pinned downstream, not in the PRD.

### No build/lint/test commands

There's no `package.json` or other manifest — nothing to build, lint, or test yet. That arrives once a stack is chosen (the not-yet-shipped `10x-tech-stack-selector` step after `/10x-prd`).
